# Pandas-challenge

Welcome to the PyCitySchools Analysis Project! This repository contains the PyCitySchools project, a comprehensive analysis of standardized test results across the city's school district. The project aims to provide data-driven insights to the school board and the mayor, assisting in strategic decision-making for future school budgets and priorities.


# Structure

- The challenge has its own folder (PyCitySchools) with the following files:
  - A .ipynb file: Jupiter Notebook Report for analysis.
  - A .docx file: Stores analysis results.
  - A Resources Folder: Contains the two datasets(schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv) to be analysed.
  - An Images Folder: Contains an image(education.png) related to the dataset.


# Execution

The project is executed in a Jupyter notebook, which includes data loading, aggregation, analysis, and visualization steps. The notebook is designed to be user-friendly, with clear comments and instructions throughout.

# Conclusion

Drug Regimen Efficacy: Summary statistics indicated that Capomulin and Ramicane were more effective in reducing tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.

Data Integrity: The data was cleansed to ensure no duplication of mouse IDs at the same timepoints. All data types were validated and corrected where necessary, providing a robust foundation for analysis.

Correlation and Regression: There was a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for the mice treated with Capomulin, suggesting that weight may influence tumor growth or response to treatment.
